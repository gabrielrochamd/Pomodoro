# Android Blank Starter

The simplest Android application template

## Project

This project is the simplest Android application possible (as far as I know). I created it to be a template, a starting point for people that want to learn Android development from the ground.

## How is this project simpler

In the creation of this project, I removed or didn't use all features that come built-in on applications created using Android Studio:

- Kotlin
- AndroidX
- Material Design
- JUnit
- Espresso

You might want to add some of those back later as your project advances but, until then, you can focus on learning the basic Android components and functionality. The removal of those tools also enables you to create more lightweight apps.
